## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to use blend modes on images thanks to a tip I saw while searching through Frontend Mentor's Discord.

For the image, I used the `picture` element in the HTML. 

To achieve the colour effect, I set a background colour on the `picture` element in the CSS and applied `mix-blend-mode: multiply` along with `opacity` on the `img` element. 

This method was much more simple and straighforward than using an absolutely positioned overlay.
